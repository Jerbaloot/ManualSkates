# ManualSkates
A skating sim where you manually control your feet in order to push yourself around.

## Requirements to Use
The project was built with Godot 4.0.2 and only tested on 4.0.2. If you would like to download and edit the source code, I recommend using Godot 4.0.2 to reduce the likelihood of any unexpected bugs appearing.

Movement is controlled using a gamepad. I used a Nintendo Switch wired controller which is read by my Windows PC as an X-input device. 

## How To
### Running the build
You can find the executables in the exports folder. ```Only the Windows executable has been tested. The html export does not work with my current export settings```

### Movement
Move Skates: Joysticks
Touch Ground: Push-down Joystick
Rotate Skates: Shoulder Bumpers

## Project Description
I like to rollerblade when I get the chance! I had the thought to make a skating sim like those awkward walking sims where you manually control your legs. I initially planned to use two mice instead of a controller. But, there are a couple of problems with that approach:

 1. Mice only sense translational motion, they don't "see" your rotation of the mouse.
 2. Your computer registers only 1 cursor at a time, and I couldn't find any workaround for that. You *could* try to manually read the inputs of the mouse data at the usb port, but I did not want to go down that road.
